# Email_Spam_Classification
In my  project focusing on email spam classification, I followed a systematic approach to ensure accuracy and efficiency:

Dataset & Jupyter Notebook Setup : I began by meticulously sourcing and preprocessing the email dataset, ensuring it was clean and suitable for analysis. Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, I streamlined the development process for optimal efficiency.

Data Preprocessing : This crucial phase involved thorough cleaning and organization of the email dataset. I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and prepared the data for subsequent analysis, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

Vectorization: Employing techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer, I transformed the textual content of emails into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step was vital for converting raw text data into a format understandable by algorithms.

Main Function : I developed the core functionality of the email spam classification system, implementing algorithms such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines. These algorithms enabled the system to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content.

Frontend/Streamlit: To enhance accessibility and user-friendliness, I designed a frontend interface using Streamlit. This interface allowed users to interact with the system seamlessly, enabling them to classify emails efficiently and mitigate spam effectively.
