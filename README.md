# Email_Spam_Classification
In my  project focusing on email spam classification, I followed a systematic approach to ensure accuracy and efficiency:
Dataset & Jupyter Notebook Setup : I began by meticulously sourcing and preprocessing the email dataset, ensuring it was clean and suitable for analysis. Leveraging Jupyter Notebooks, I streamlined the development process for optimal efficiency.

Data Preprocessing : This crucial phase involved thorough cleaning and organization of the email dataset. I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and prepared the data for subsequent analysis, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

Vectorization: Employing techniques like  CountVectorizer, I transformed the textual content of emails into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step was vital for converting raw text data into a format understandable by algorithms.

Main Function : I developed the core functionality of the email spam classification system, implementing algorithms such as Naive Bayes- MultinomialNB. These algorithms enabled the system to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content.

Frontend/Streamlit: To enhance accessibility and user-friendliness, I designed a frontend interface using Streamlit. This interface allowed users to interact with the system seamlessly, enabling them to classify emails efficiently and mitigate spam effectively.
